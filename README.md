## Creating sample producer and consumer using Spring boot

* This repo has sample consumer and producer services.
* Account service acts as consumer. User service acts as producer.
* Both of them are exposed at same port with different base URI (/account for account and /user for user) (6060)
* Account service uses /user end point to create an account.
* Clone this repo.
* Do a maven build.

    ```mvn clean install```

* To start the consumer application run:

    ``` java -jar consumer/target/consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ```
    
* To start the producer application run:

    ``` java -jar producer/target/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ```

* Import below curls in postman to interact with the application.
